Content Strategy for Instagram (Artistt app),
  For example,
  niche = UI/UX Designs
 - Share UI/UX Designs posts, can use  .
 - Follow big accounts(large followers) in UI/UX niche.
 - Find other UI/UX small accounts(less followers) from the followers list of big account (large followers)
 - Follow, Communicate and engage with smaller accounts as well by like, share, comments etc .
 - Promote Pages of smaller accounts in UI/UX designers because that's our main task to promote people and
   this is what our app will do. So this account will act as a proxy for artistt app as well.
  We need to do the same for other niches as well. We need 2-3 niches only till 1000 followers.
