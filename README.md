     a lot from their own self.

### Total Timeline 
#### - min : 10 days + 21 days = 1 months
#### - max : 2 months + 6 months = 8 months


Stage II : People must know you are enugh valuable to get the regular things done

Q. How to get people know what problem you are trying to solve.

- You need to start providing the existing or little improved version of solutions.
- at least few people start believing in your capabilities.
- you must know your target audience, you can't invite everyone.

If you already know your target audience and strategy to invite them then you can do it within next 15 days.

### Timeline (after 500 people) :
#### - min : 15 days 
#### - max : 4 months
#### - Sigo : 2 months

Don't s

- inviting everyone or not having a plan.
- overthinking about yourself and judging your self worth on the basis of other people opinion like you aren't good enough. It might be true that you aren't good enough but you will be good enough soon.
  
#### Stage I and Stage II are strictly for making people aware about your existence and your intentions. Don't overthink and expect much. You don't need to be talented in order to do this you just need consistency and good behaviour nothing more

Stage I and II can be done in a single day as well if you find someone else doing similar thing (50% similar to what you want to pursue) but you need strategy to migrate current audience into new vision. You can do it by

- Partnership. (Making the account owner as marketing partner, it is the best thing you can do as business isn't independent entity, the business requires multi dimensional solutions).

- Acquire the account with the help of some genuine 3rd party service like Social Tradia (for Instagram) where people buy and sell accounts legit way with the help of some third party service who does things like that. They will do the background verification and all kinds of things for you so that you don't have to worry about it later.

Stage III : People must know that your are trustworthy and reliable

   - The selection of platform plays key role, if you want to grow more faster and better then you must know the best platform for you.

   - by improving skills and knowledge about the solutions you are providing
   - by letting people know that you deliver on time, your are trustworthy and reliable.
   - by making better content and branding strategy to get more people interested in you.

### Timeline (after 1 K+)
#### - min : 4 months
#### - max : 2 years   
#### - Mona.marketing : 11 months

#### Stage III can be done in a single day by official partnership or official acquire but it requires more thinking because migration of the huge audience to new vision is difficult and generating the engagement of similar kind is also difficult and existing account has to be 80% similar with your vision. You may get the social account cheap but you won't be able to utilise and sustain it's growth and engagement. Consult social media marketing manager or someone in domain before doing such things and pay them to strategize things up because you need a lots of planning to make that shift successfully.

   - you need original thinking and creativity.
   - you have to become exceptionally good at your offerings and you are equivalent to a media company.

### Timeline (after 10 K+ people):
#### - min : 3 months
#### - max : 5 years
#### - Ekta Dixit : 1 year
   
#### Stage IV can't be done in a single day and it needs some real talent to do such thing consistently. You can make that person brand ambassador and key promoter to get the similar results for your company.

# App Marketing

Stage I : Finding the similar app to the app you wish to develop

## Delhi Metro Traveller : 10 K+ people

Q. What you wish to develop ? Is there any app which is used by lots of people similar to your app by 30 % ?

A. I wish to create a journey planner app which plan the tour for me from a given starting point in a way that I don't have to worry about anything while travelling. I started visiting tourist places of Delhi via metro train in 2nd year of my college as it was very easy, convenient and cheap and I don't need permission from my parents to travel as I can go back to the home the same day. The travel structure is similar even if I visit some different city, we always need a place to stay within the city and we need to get back to that place at the end of the day as well. During travelling I found few problems like no information about nearby toilets and parking within metro app which I used and also the list of nearby tourist places, shopping malls, places to eat etc to the particular metro station. What will happen if I create a journey planner which tells me step by step like where to go in which sequence so that I can eat good food, travelled to the place and always found parking and toilets in the route in order to make my journey super convenient. I realised that if I am able to create such thing then I will be able to fulfil my dream to become the traveller who travelled across 192 countries with the help of money I earn from ads. I built that app in Jan 2017 (3rd year-6th semester and it took me 2 months), I had no idea about how business works and no idea about how engineering works as well or the amount of technical expertise and investment required to create such thing and also the potential revenue it can bring if implemented properly as I was a 13 year old teenager girl who got some freedom to travel in her own city and nearby but still I manage to think like what should I need to do in order to improve the reach of my app so I thought of launching the Delhi metro app with features like train routes, nearby toilets, parking and places to visit and also embed the web browser to search other things with the help of search buttons which allow me to find other things as well.

#### Timeline :
-   100 - 1 week
-   1,000 - 3 weeks
-   10,000 - 2 months

Stage II : Finding the way to grow and sustain more users with the help of users feedback and responses.

## Khabri : 100 K+ users (Currently 2 Mn+ users with 2 Mn USD funding)

Q. How did Khabri get its first set of users?

A. The idea of the app was to broadcast news. Therefore, we started with broadcasting small snippets of audio news in an easily consumable manner. We got family and friends to download the app. The first 5000 - 7000 downloads were purely word of mouth.
Once we exhausted the downloads from all our contacts. We had a dataset that we could study. But, the problem was the information did not allow us to draw lines. One thing that we learned as a B2C company was not to try and solve all the issues at the same time.
Therefore, we targeted at getting 50K downloads within the next 3 months. This dataset would allow us to perform analytics. But the question was how do we get 50K downloads in 3 months?
The big breakâ€¦
For an app like ours, we need advertising. That was the only way by which more people would reach out to us. But, how to promote a B2C company organically?
We reached out to journalists from different magazines and newspapers to write about our app. But, at this stage, we were still curating news articles, thereby making it impossible for press giants to write about us. It was against their policy to promote a news channel.
We then realized the mistake that we were making...
The main idea of the app was to promote content in the national language so that it reaches out to even the rural part of India. In a country like ours, 70% of the population are from rural areas. Once we cracked this, we went after the rural press. We contacted journalists from small towns and villages and asked them if they can spread the word. After this, we started gaining traction. We were getting about 2000 - 4000 downloads in a day.
Now that we had the data that we needed, we wanted to grow. When it came to growth, we tried a lot of strategies - blogging, student referrals, Social media groups, etc. But nothing gave us the traction like PR.
On analysing deeper, we noticed something unique about the viewership. It dawned to us that our users were using our app to gain General Knowledge. This opened a lot of verticals for us. Until then, the app was primarily a news channel. This opened the horizons for a lot of categories such as motivation, self-help, etc.
Now that we had cracked the market, we needed creators. It was difficult to get creators because our user base was still less. And, we couldnâ€™t acquire users because we did not have enough content.
At this point, we started looking out for pod-casters. We noticed that a lot of the creators were posting content on Youtube with a static image because there was no platform for audio.
We identified the top 20 creators and suggested that they publish content on another platform such as Khrabi in addition to Youtube. Some of them agreed and along with these creators came their user base.
